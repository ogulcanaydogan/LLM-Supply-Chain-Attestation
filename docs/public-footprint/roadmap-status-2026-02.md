## Workstream Status

| Workstream | Target | Current | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS1: Upstream conversion | `>=1` merged external PR | `1` merged (`cosign#4710`), `1` open (`scorecard#4942`) | complete (minimum target met) |
| WS2: CI pass-rate | rolling `>=95%` | rolling `97.65% (83/85)`; post-hardening `98.78% (81/82)` | complete |
| WS3: `v1.0.1` hardening evidence | release + verification artifacts complete | complete with release and verification runs linked | complete |
| WS4: Evidence automation | one-command refresh and source-traceable docs | complete (`public-footprint-snapshot`, `ci-health-snapshot`, `generate-evidence-pack`) | complete |
| WS5: Third-party mention | canonical non-GitHub publication URL | canonical URL set to Dev.to article | complete |

## Automated Completion Verdict

- Strict complete: `true`
- Practical complete: `true`
- Blockers: none

## WS2 Closure Note

The rolling 30-day CI pass rate now exceeds the strict target:

1. **Strict threshold met.** Rolling CI pass rate is `97.65%` (`83/85`), above the `>=95%` requirement.
2. **Post-hardening trend remains strong.** Since `2026-02-19T16:08:22Z`, post-hardening pass rate is `98.78%` (`81/82`).
3. **Decision:** WS2 is complete under strict criteria, without acceptance override.

## Closure Summary

All 5 Day-30 roadmap workstreams are complete:

1. **WS1 (Upstream conversion):** met — `cosign#4710` merged.
2. **WS2 (CI pass-rate):** met — strict rolling threshold satisfied (`97.65%`).
3. **WS3 (v1.0.1 hardening):** met — release and verification artifacts published.
4. **WS4 (Evidence automation):** met — one-command refresh scripts wired to weekly workflow.
5. **WS5 (Third-party mention):** met — canonical Dev.to article published and linked.

## Runtime/Infra Profile

- Current execution model: GitHub Actions workflows plus local Go CLI tooling.
- Not used in this repository runtime/process: NVIDIA `V100`, NVIDIA `A100`, Apache Spark.
- Update trigger: revise this profile only when a GPU/Spark benchmark lane is added to public evidence.
