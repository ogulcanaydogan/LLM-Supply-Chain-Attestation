# Roadmap Status (2026-02)

This page tracks execution status against the Day-30 public-footprint roadmap.

## Snapshot

- Generated: 2026-02-19 UTC
- Scope: `llmsa` public footprint only
- Source of truth:
  - `docs/public-footprint/evidence-pack-2026-02-18.md`
  - `docs/public-footprint/measurement-dashboard.md`
  - `docs/public-footprint/external-contribution-log.md`
  - latest completion check: `.llmsa/public-footprint/*/roadmap-completion.json` (generated by `scripts/roadmap-completion-check.sh`)

## Workstream Status

| Workstream | Target | Current | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS1: Upstream conversion | `>=1` merged external PR | `1` merged (`cosign#4710`), `1` open (`scorecard#4942`) | complete (minimum target met) |
| WS2: CI pass-rate | rolling `>=95%` | rolling `87.72% (50/57)`; post-hardening `100% (17/17)` | partially complete |
| WS3: `v1.0.1` hardening evidence | release + verification artifacts complete | complete with release and verification runs linked | complete |
| WS4: Evidence automation | one-command refresh and source-traceable docs | complete (`public-footprint-snapshot`, `ci-health-snapshot`, `generate-evidence-pack`) | complete |
| WS5: Third-party mention | canonical non-GitHub publication URL | still gist mirror; Dev.to workflow blocked by missing `DEVTO_API_KEY` | blocked (credential dependency) |

## Automated Completion Verdict

- Strict complete: `false`
- Practical complete: `false`
- Blockers:
  - A canonical third-party mention URL (non-GitHub/Gist) is required.
  - Rolling 30-day CI pass rate is below target (`87.72%`, target `>=95%`).

## Completion Gates Remaining

1. Canonical publication:
   - Set repository secret `DEVTO_API_KEY`.
   - Run `.github/workflows/publish-third-party-mention.yml`.
   - Replace gist-primary mention with canonical URL in evidence docs.
2. Rolling-window CI target:
   - Keep workflows green so historical failures age out of the 30-day denominator.
   - Recompute rolling pass-rate in each snapshot cycle.

## Practical Endgame

When the roadmap is considered complete:

1. `>=1` upstream PR is merged and reflected in docs.
2. Canonical third-party mention URL is published and linked from evidence pack.
3. Rolling CI pass-rate is `>=95%` or explicitly justified with post-hardening trend and an updated acceptance note.
