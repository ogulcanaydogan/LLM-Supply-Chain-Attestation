# v1.0.1 Hardening Closure Checklist

Use this page to make hardening closure visible through public artifacts.

## Scope

`v1.0.1` is hardening-only:

- CI reliability improvements (retry/preflight/timeout/concurrency).
- Public-footprint evidence automation.
- Upstream follow-up cadence automation.
- No breaking CLI interface changes.

## Completion Checklist

- [x] Release tag and notes published.
- [x] Security/tamper benchmark artifacts linked.
- [x] CI pass evidence linked.
- [x] Hardening fixes mapped to concrete files/workflows.
- [x] Non-claims and limitations updated.

## Hardening Delta Mapped to Files

1. CI reliability:
   - `.github/workflows/ci-attest-verify.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/release-verify.yml`
2. Public-footprint automation:
   - `scripts/ci-health-snapshot.sh`
   - `scripts/generate-evidence-pack.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/public-footprint-weekly.yml`
3. Upstream PR conversion cadence:
   - `scripts/upstream-pr-followup.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/upstream-pr-followup.yml`
4. Source data extension:
   - `scripts/public-footprint-snapshot.sh` (additive upstream PR fields)

## Deferred Items and Risk Notes

1. CI pass-rate target (`>=95%`) not yet met in rolling 30-day window.
   - reason: earlier failed runs remain in denominator (`90.91%`, 70/77) despite current run reliability being green.
   - counter-signal: post-hardening window pass rate is `100%` (`37/37`).
   - risk: reliability KPI is still below the stated Day-30 target.
   - follow-up: keep weekly runs green and reassess once failed runs age out of the 30-day window.
2. Third-party canonical mention URL is now complete.
   - evidence: https://dev.to/ogulcanaydogan/i-spent-3-months-solving-a-security-gap-nobody-talks-about-llm-artifact-integrity-6co
   - note: machine source-of-truth is `docs/public-footprint/third-party-mention-canonical-url.txt`.
3. Upstream merge conversion remains partially open.
   - reason: minimum conversion target is met (`cosign#4710` merged), but one upstream PR remains open (`scorecard#4942`) and OPA attempts (#8343, #8346) were closed unmerged.
   - risk: additional external-validation depth is still limited while only one line has merged.
   - follow-up: continue 48-hour maintainer cadence on the remaining open PR and keep OPA guidance in project-local docs.
