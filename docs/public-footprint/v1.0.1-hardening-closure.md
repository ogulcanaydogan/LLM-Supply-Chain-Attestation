# v1.0.1 Hardening Closure Checklist

Use this page to make hardening closure visible through public artifacts.

## Scope

`v1.0.1` is hardening-only:

- CI reliability improvements (retry/preflight/timeout/concurrency).
- Public-footprint evidence automation.
- Upstream follow-up cadence automation.
- No breaking CLI interface changes.

## Completion Checklist

- [x] Release tag and notes published.
- [x] Security/tamper benchmark artifacts linked.
- [x] CI pass evidence linked.
- [x] Hardening fixes mapped to concrete files/workflows.
- [x] Non-claims and limitations updated.

## Hardening Delta Mapped to Files

1. CI reliability:
   - `.github/workflows/ci-attest-verify.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/release-verify.yml`
2. Public-footprint automation:
   - `scripts/ci-health-snapshot.sh`
   - `scripts/generate-evidence-pack.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/public-footprint-weekly.yml`
3. Upstream PR conversion cadence:
   - `scripts/upstream-pr-followup.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/upstream-pr-followup.yml`
4. Source data extension:
   - `scripts/public-footprint-snapshot.sh` (additive upstream PR fields)

## Deferred Items and Risk Notes

1. CI pass-rate target (`>=95%`) not yet met in rolling 30-day window.
   - reason: earlier failed runs remain in denominator (`83%`, 34/41) despite current run reliability being green.
   - risk: reliability KPI is still below the stated Day-30 target.
   - follow-up: keep weekly runs green and reassess once failed runs age out of the 30-day window.
2. Third-party canonical mention URL still pending.
   - reason: current mention exists only as GitHub Gist mirror.
   - risk: weaker external-validation signal than independent publication channel.
   - follow-up: publish canonical write-up (Dev.to/Medium/newsletter) and update evidence pack URL.
3. Upstream merge conversion remains incomplete.
   - reason: OPA PR #8343 and fallback #8346 were both closed unmerged for this topic; other two upstream PRs remain open.
   - risk: merged external-validation evidence still at `0`.
   - follow-up: continue 48-hour maintainer cadence on open PRs (`cosign#4710`, `scorecard#4942`) and use a different OPA contribution scope if pursuing OPA again.
