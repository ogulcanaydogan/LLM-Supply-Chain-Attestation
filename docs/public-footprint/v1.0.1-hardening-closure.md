# v1.0.1 Hardening Closure Checklist

Use this page to make hardening closure visible through public artifacts.

## Scope

`v1.0.1` is hardening-only:

- CI reliability improvements (retry/preflight/timeout/concurrency).
- Public-footprint evidence automation.
- Upstream follow-up cadence automation.
- No breaking CLI interface changes.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Release tag and notes published.
- [x] Security/tamper benchmark artifacts linked.
- [x] CI pass evidence linked.
- [x] Hardening fixes mapped to concrete files/workflows.
- [x] Non-claims and limitations updated.

## Hardening Delta Mapped to Files

1. CI reliability:
   - `.github/workflows/ci-attest-verify.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/release-verify.yml`
2. Public-footprint automation:
   - `scripts/ci-health-snapshot.sh`
   - `scripts/generate-evidence-pack.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/public-footprint-weekly.yml`
3. Upstream PR conversion cadence:
   - `scripts/upstream-pr-followup.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/upstream-pr-followup.yml`
4. Source data extension:
   - `scripts/public-footprint-snapshot.sh` (additive upstream PR fields)

## Deferred Items and Risk Notes

1. `v1.0.1` release tag not cut yet.
   - reason: waiting for final pass-rate refresh and evidence regeneration on authenticated GitHub session.
   - risk: closure remains "in-progress" rather than release-complete.
   - follow-up: tag/publish once CI-health snapshot and evidence pack are regenerated with fresh authenticated data.
2. Third-party canonical mention URL still pending.
   - reason: current mention exists only as GitHub Gist mirror.
   - risk: weaker external-validation signal than independent publication channel.
   - follow-up: publish canonical write-up (Dev.to/Medium/newsletter) and update evidence pack URL.
